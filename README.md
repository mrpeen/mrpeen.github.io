This project has been bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You need to have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed to run it, but if you really do not want to install it then you should be fine with npm as well.

## Run

```
yarn
yarn start
```

## Deploy

This part is still annoying since this is an organisation page on github. This means I usually:

- run `yarn build` on this dev branch;
- copy the content of the newly created `build` directory;
- switch to the `master` branch;
- paste in the root directory.

Unfortunately the master needs to host the compiled code because for organisation page github does not allow to choose a branch (it is always master).
